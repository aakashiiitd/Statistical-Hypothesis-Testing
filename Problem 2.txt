”To Breakfast or Not to Breakfast?” by Richard Ayore

In the American society, birthdays are one of those days that everyone looks for-
ward to. People of different ages and peer groups gather to mark the 18th, 20th, .

. . birthdays. During this time, one looks back to see what he or she had achieved
for the past year, and also focuses ahead for more to come. If, by any chance, I
am invited to one of these parties, my experience is always different. Instead of
dancing around with my friends while the music is booming, I get carried away by
memories of my family back home in Kenya. I remember the good times I had with
my brothers and sister while we did our daily routine. Every morning, I remember
we went to the shamba (garden) to weed our crops. I remember one day arguing
with my brother as to why he always remained behind just to join us an hour later.
In his defense, he said that he preferred waiting for breakfast before he came to
weed. He said, ”This is why I always work more hours than you guys!” And so, to
prove his wrong or right, we decided to give it a try. One day we went to work as
usual without breakfast, and recorded the time we could work before getting tired
and stopping. On the next day, we all ate breakfast before going to work. We
recorded how long we worked again before getting tired and stopping. Of interest
was our mean increase in work time. Though not sure, my brother insisted that it
is more than two hours. Using the data below, solve our problem.
