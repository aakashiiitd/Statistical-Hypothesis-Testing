An interesting Japanese problem by Kumi Furuichi
It used to be very typical for Japanese girls’ names to end with ”ko.” (The trend
might have started around my grandmothers’ generation and its peak might have
been around my mother’s generation.) ”Ko” means ”child” in Chinese character.

Parents would name their daughters with ”ko” attaching to other Chinese char-
acters which have meanings that they want their daughters to become, such as

Sachiko – a happy child, Yoshiko – a good child, Yasuko – a healthy child, and so
on. However, I noticed recently that only two out of nine of my Japanese girlfriends
at this school have names which end with ”ko.” More and more, parents seem to
have become creative, modernized, and, sometimes, westernized in naming their

children. I have a feeling that, while 70 percent or more of my mother’s genera-
tion would have names with ”ko” at the end, the proportion has dropped among

my peers. I wrote down all my Japanese friends’, ex-classmates’, co-workers, and
acquaintances’ names that I could remember. Below are the names. (Some are
repeats.) Test to see if the proportion has dropped for this generation.
